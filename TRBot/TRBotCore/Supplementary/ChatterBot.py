# This is a Python source file to run a local ChatterBot for chatbot conversations on your stream
# Run this program separately with "python ChatterBot.py"
# It's recommended to run this in the TRBot Data folder at first
# You will need to install Python and ChatterBot as prerequisites (https://chatterbot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/setup.html)

# Overview: This opens a socket with a file used for the data
# After a client sends data through the socket, it feeds that into the bot as a prompt and sends back a response
# This essentially lets users talk with a bot

# Don't hesitate to change any of this to get your desired chatbot behavior - this is just a sample setup
# See more information on the official documentation (https://chatterbot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)
